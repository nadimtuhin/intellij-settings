# Intellij Settings
I used to use Intellij Idea for all sorts of development. Then as time passed IDEA grew fat, which resulted in slow startup. So currently using Webstorm, Pycharm, Android Studio separately. Then it became a mess to share my settings with others. Also manually exporting settings to my desktop is also a pain which run Linux. So I had to manually import things other than the full settings jar file.

This repo will contain all my intellij settings so I wont need to think of sharing my settings cross ide or cross device. If I change settings in the IDE this repo will be automatically updated.

Here is the official guide to do this https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2017.1/sharing-your-ide-settings.html
